A minimal sample to demonstrate using FastAPI and Vue in a single repo using [devcontainers](https://containers.dev) for local development and a [multi stage Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) for building a "production" container with both the Vue-UI and the FastAPI-API.
